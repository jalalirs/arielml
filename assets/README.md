## Taking Screenshots

To capture a good screenshot of the Data Inspector:

1. Run `python tools/data_inspector.py`
2. Load a planet with interesting transit data
3. Switch to a mode that shows multiple plots (e.g., Bayesian Pipeline)
4. Ensure the interface shows:
   - Navigation panel with planet selection
   - Settings panel with parameters
   - Multiple visualization tabs
   - Active plots with data
5. Take a high-resolution screenshot
6. Save as `data_inspector_screenshot.png`
